# NEA
A dodgy graph program

This is a version of a program I made for my Computer Science A Level NEA, with the intent to be able to create graphs, draw them, save them, and run
several algorithms on them. Originally I intended to implement Kruskals, Prims and Dijkstras, but my lacking experience and spaghetti code means that
the only function algorithms are cycle detection and Kruskals.

I might come back to this project and fix it eventually, but may not.
