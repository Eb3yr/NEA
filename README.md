# NEA
A dodgy graph program

This is a version of a program I made for my Computer Science A Level NEA, with the intent to be able to create graphs, draw them, save them, and run
several algorithms on them. Originally I intended to implement Kruskals, Prims and Dijkstras, but my lacking experience and spaghetti code means that
the only functional algorithms are cycle detection and Kruskals. Prims and Dijkstras are available as options, but they WILL break.
Your sanity is forefeit if you look at it too hard.

I might come back to this project and fix it some day, but probably won't. Making this public now that 2023 A Level results have been released.
